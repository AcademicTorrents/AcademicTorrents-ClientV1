this is the SystemUtils.so shared library for linux.

currently it only supports toggling fullscreen through the JNI-enabled api: toggleFullScreen.

NOTE:
in order to get this project to build on linux, you may need to install the X11 development lib.  you can do this by running: sudo apt-get install libx11-dev.
