     * For best performance, the caller should follow these guidelines:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Provide an explicit projection, to prevent
     * reading data from storage that aren't going to be used.</li>
     * <li>Use question mark parameter markers such as 'phone=?' instead of

     * that differ only by those values will be recognized as the same

     * @param uri The URI, using the content:// scheme, for the content to
     *         retrieve.
     * @param projection A list of which columns to return. Passing null will
     *         return all columns, which is inefficient.
     * @param selection A filter declaring which rows to return, formatted as an
     *         SQL WHERE clause (excluding the WHERE itself). Passing null will
     *         return all rows for the given URI.
     * @param selectionArgs You may include ?s in selection, which will be
     *         replaced by the values from selectionArgs, in the order that they
     *         appear in the selection. The values will be bound as Strings.
     * @param sortOrder How to order the rows, formatted as an SQL ORDER BY
     *         clause (excluding the ORDER BY itself). Passing null will use the
     *         default sort order, which may be unordered.
     * @return A Cursor object, which is positioned before the first entry, or null
     * @see Cursor
