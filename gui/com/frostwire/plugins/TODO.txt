CLIENT:
 - PluginManager: checkForInstalledPlugins(), checkForAvailablePluginsLocally(), 
  installPlugin(), uninstallPlugin(), runPlugin() -> PluginLoader.runPlugin() ->
  Plugin.run(), same thing with stopPlugin()
 - Add 'category' attribute (not sure, maybe plugins manifests will just be saved under
   sub folders that will represent categories)
 - Add 'oses' attribute. If not present or ="*", the plugin is supposed to be 
   compatible with all OSes. (windows,mac,linux) [like update.frostwire.com]
 - On MetaPlugin.isValid() will have to add check for OS compatiblity
 - Add 'icon' attribute. If not present frostwire will provide
   default icons. The plugin meta description on the server manifest should have
   the URL of a standard sized PNG (32x32)
 - Add 'description' attribute. Couple of sentences explaining what the plugin
   can do.
 - Create view classes (already have a couple mock up on paper on how the 
 PluginManagerView should look like)

 
SERVER:
 - Add 'supported_environments' attribute
 - Log XML parsing errors of includes/disk.plugin.reader.php on an error log.
   This should probably be a setting of the system.
 - Add 'category' attribute so that frostwire (sometime down the line if all this works out)
   can be able to show categorized plugins based on this. We are able to control
   the category names server side.
 - Implement updating a manifest by invoking something like
   http://plugins.frostwire.com/update/<developer>/<pluginName>/<devPass>

   The rough logic on the server will be as follows:
   
   //Read remote manifest (after validation of update request
   //has occurred)
   
   //Replace the one...
   $memDict->put($plugin->getName(), $plugin->asXML())
   
   //Rebuild the XML
   $keys = $memDict->getDictKeys();
   
   $theXML = '<?xml version="1.0"?><plugins>";
   
   foreach ($keys as $pluginName) {
      $theXML .= $memDict->get($pluginName)->asXML();
   }
   
   $theXML = '</plugins>';
   
   //Replace OLD XML with new XML
   $memDict->put('xml',$theXML);
